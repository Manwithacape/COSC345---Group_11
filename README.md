Group_11
===============
# Github/Gitbucket Dual Push
*Daniel needs to add you to the GitHub repository before you can push to it*

CD to the cloned down isgb repo

run this: `git remote set-url --add --push origin https://isgb.otago.ac.nz/cosc345/git/paxda981/Group_11.git`

then this `git remote set-url --add --push origin https://github.com/Manwithacape/COSC345---Group_11.git`

now pulling only pulls from isgb. pushing now pushes to isgb and github.

as always pull before you push.
