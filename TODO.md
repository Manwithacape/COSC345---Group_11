# To do

## Notes

---

- [ ] Work flows should only run on main

### Must have

- [ ] Collections management - create collection using selection of files
- [ ] ML for photo scores - start with being able to differenciate between good and bad
- [ ] add a threshold param for displaying images based on quality
- [ ] Face detection - save to DB
- [x] Test duplicate detection - maybe run on import? compare each image to prev for better consistency throughout burst
- [ ] Create thumbnails on import, save thumbnails to DB, perform operations on thumbnails rather than full images for better performance
- [ ] Static analysis fixes
- [ ] Face detection accuracy needs improvment - Issue #13
- [ ] Sidebar faces flexible grid layout? - Issue #14
- [ ] Full image view only works on some images when multiple are imported? - Issue #17
- [ ] Highlight suggested culls based on score
- [ ] Import validation
- [ ] Collection management - highlight, add, remove photos from collections
- [ ] Filter thumbnail view using exif - date, camera, etc.
- [x] Create new documentation for current system architecture
- [ ] Set thresholds for good photo
- [ ] Thumbnail highlighting based on photo goodness
- [ ] Show suggested photos for deletion/keeping
- [ ] photo_viewer.py need scale options
- [ ]  single_photo_viewer.py needs LLM
