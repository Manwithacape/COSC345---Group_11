# Communication Plan – PhotoSIFT

## Purpose  
This plan ensures clear, respectful, and efficient communication within the team, allowing us to stay organised, meet deadlines, and produce high-quality work.  

---

## Communication Tools  
- **Primary Communication:** Discord  
- **Version Control:** GitHub / GitLab (all code contributions must go through commits and pull requests)  
- **Task Management:** Taiga  

---

## Meeting Structure  
- **Weekly Stand-Up Meeting (30–45 minutes during tutorial slots):**  
  - Share progress since last meeting  
  - Discuss blockers and challenges  
  - Agree on next steps  
- **Extra Meetings:** Scheduled where needed (major milestones, troubleshooting sessions)  

---

## Rules & Expectations  

### General Etiquette  
- Be respectful and constructive in all communications  
- Assume positive intent — ask for clarification rather than making assumptions  
- Use clear, concise, and professional language  

### Availability & Responsiveness  
- Reply to team messages within 24 hours (unless stated otherwise)  
- If unavailable (due to exams, illness, etc.), notify the team in advance  
- Attend all scheduled meetings or inform the group if you cannot attend  
- Working hours: 9:00am-5:00pm

### Work Practices  
- **Git Usage:**  
  - Pull before pushing  
  - Write clear commit messages  
  - Create branches for new features and use pull requests  
  - *Daniel is our Git god*  
- **Documentation:** Keep code commented and update shared documentation regularly  
- **Deadlines:** Commit to agreed timelines. Raise issues early if you cannot meet them  
- **Task Ownership:** Take responsibility for assigned tasks and update the team when complete  

---

## Conflict Resolution  
1. Address issues directly with the person involved in a respectful way  
2. If unresolved, raise the matter at the next meeting for group discussion  

---

## Good Practices  
- Use relevant Discord channels for topic-specific discussions to reduce clutter  
- Take meeting minutes for future reference  
- Encourage equal participation — all voices and ideas matter  
- Share progress frequently rather than waiting until tasks are complete  
- Regularly review project goals to stay aligned

## Review  
This communication plan will be reviewed at **Sprint 3** to check effectiveness and update if necessary.
