# Notes for the use of LLM for the project 
- Will be using a ollama model
- Passing it a json file of the scores that are produced by openCV
- as its a local model (within the project) needs to lightweight 
Qwen2.5 reccomended by LLM due to it being a licensed under apache 2.0
- Have the model only see the summarised facts, doesn't need to see raw images
- All the model will do is regurgitate the facts in a conciese paragraph 
 ## UI for the llm paragraph 
 - Bar: noting good/bad things about the photo
 - Feedback card 3-5 recs + jump to examples button?
