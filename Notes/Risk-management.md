# Risk Analysis – PhotoSIFT

## Purpose  
This document identifies potential risks that could affect the success of the project. Each risk is analysed in terms of its likelihood, impact, exposure, and mitigation strategies to reduce its effect on the project.  

---

## Risk Assessment Criteria  

- **Likelihood:**  
  - Low = 1 (Unlikely to occur)  
  - Medium = 2 (Could occur)  
  - High = 3 (Likely to occur)  

- **Impact:**  
  - Low = 1 (Minimal disruption to project progress)  
  - Medium = 2 (Noticeable disruption, may delay some tasks)  
  - High = 3 (Severe disruption, could threaten project completion)  

- **Exposure:** Likelihood × Impact  
  - 1–2 = Low  
  - 3–4 = Medium  
  - 6–9 = High

## Risk Register  

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Exposure | Mitigation Strategy | Risk Owner |
|------|------------|--------|----------|----------------------|------------|
| **Python – project scale** | 2 (Medium) | 3 (High) | 6 (High) | Research best practices, divide tasks into smaller modules, conduct peer reviews | All members |
| **AI implementation – complexity** | 3 (High) | 3 (High) | 9 (High) | Start early with prototyping, consult documentation, simplify model where necessary | AI lead |
| **Python to PostgreSQL connection** | 2 (Medium) | 2 (Medium) | 4 (Medium) | Assign one member to specialise in DB connection early, document steps clearly, test with small datasets | Backend lead |
| **Photography knowledge** | 2 (Medium) | 2 (Medium) | 4 (Medium) | Research basics of photography, consult online resources, focus on software functionality over domain expertise | All members |
| **Python GUI development** | 2 (Medium) | 3 (High) | 6 (High) | Use frameworks with good documentation, start with minimal UI, iterate gradually | Frontend lead |
| **Time management** | 3 (High) | 3 (High) | 9 (High) | Use Taiga board to track tasks, set realistic sprint goals, hold team members accountable | Project manager |
| **Team availability** | 2 (Medium) | 2 (Medium) | 4 (Medium) | Share knowledge across team, document code and processes, redistribute tasks when needed | Project manager |
| **Scope creep** | 2 (Medium) | 3 (High) | 6 (High) | Stick to MVP first, prioritise must-have features, document and defer extras for later | Project manager |
| **Dependency risks** | 2 (Medium) | 2 (Medium) | 4 (Medium) | Choose well-supported libraries, lock versions, identify fallback options | Technical lead |
| **Integration issues** | 2 (Medium) | 3 (High) | 6 (High) | Perform regular integration testing, use version control effectively | All developers |
| **Communication breakdown** | 2 (Medium) | 3 (High) | 6 (High) | Follow communication plan, hold regular meetings, document decisions | All members |

## Monitoring & Review  
- Risks will be reviewed at the **end of each sprint**.  
- Exposure levels will be recalculated if likelihood or impact changes.  
- New risks will be added if identified.  
- Mitigation strategies and risk owners will be updated based on progress and feedback.
